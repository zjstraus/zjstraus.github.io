## Hi - Zach here.

I'm a programmer and sysadmin at Smart Monkeys, Inc working with the ISAAC Platform. I'm currently serving as a main technical contact for partner integrators, 
handling system production and commissioning, doing software development, and going "in the field" to train and assist internal and external users.
